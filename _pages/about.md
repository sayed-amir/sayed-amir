<div> I am an Associate Lecturer at UNSW Canberra, where I focus on wireless communications, 5G networks, and cybersecurity. I earned my BSc in Electronic Engineering from Isfahan University of Technology and my MSc in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Amirkabir University of Technology in Iran. In 2017, I completed my PhD in Computer Science and Engineering at UNSW Sydney.

I joined UNSW Canberra in 2020, where my research focuses on wireless communication technologies such as 5G/6G networks and network security. I am particularly interested in developing cost-effective, real-world solutions for physical layer security (PLS) and private 5G networks, exploring their applications in both commercial and industry settings. My work bridges theoretical advancements with practical implementations, addressing challenges in network performance, cybersecurity, and emerging communication technologies.</div>
